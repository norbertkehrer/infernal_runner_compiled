# Infernal Runner Compiled to JavaScript

This is a JavaScript port of the Amstrad CPC game "Infernal Runner" made by Eric Chahi in 1985.
It is built from the virtual machine interpreter code of Gregory Montoir (https://github.com/cyxx/infernal_js).
I compiled the bytecode to native JavaScript in order to eliminate the interpretive layer and having the whole game as a pure JavaScript program.

Have fun!
